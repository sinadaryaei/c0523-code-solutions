## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- What is a function in JavaScript?
  A function is packaged code that can be used later in your program.
  Combination lines of code that can be reused through out you JavaScript.

- Describe the parts of a function **definition**.
  A `function` keyword, a optional name with, a `,` comma that seperates zero or more
  parameters surrounded by `()` parentheses, followed by a opening curly brace `{` for
  the code block, and a optional return statement, ending with a closing curly brace for
  the code block `}`.

- Describe the parts of a function **call**.
  The funciton **call** is written by placing the name of the function followed by parentheses `()` and a semi colon `;`.

- When comparing them side-by-side, what are the differences between a function **call** and a function **definition**?

The **call** needs to be defined first before it can be called. The function **definition**
has to be created first, it's like a object, but it can be called.

- What is the difference between a **parameter** and an **argument**?

A **parameter** is a placeholder, a variable who's value is not known until we call a function,
and we pass its **argument** a `string`.

- Why are function **parameters** useful?
  Function **parameters** are useful because they are placeholders to pass **arguements**.

- What two effects does a `return` statement have on the behavior of a function?
  The `return` statement causes the function to produce a value to use in our program, or
  prevents any more code in the function's code block from being run.
